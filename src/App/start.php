// get a list of of routes
// for each route, match a controller
// this is a very good start: https://reintech.io/blog/building-php-mvc-framework-from-scratch 

// however, I think creating a request class from scratch would be a much better learning experience as we'll use it later on and it can be passed around from 
// controller to model to view if needed. 

// Nope, a request class is a terible start point. Is dry, boring and I only need from it 2-3 methods. 
// Better of starting without one and maybe I'll implement one later one with just what I need.
